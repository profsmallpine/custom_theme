# Custom Theme Demo w/Multi-Tenancy (scopes)
The purpose of this demo is to show how to use a sass variables file to control theming that the user can edit and see the results immediately. The sass variables file draws from the database, and the cache is cleared upon adding a new theme color so that the new results are compiled.
